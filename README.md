My main goal with this project is building a raytracer engine that is physically based. My two primary source of knowledges are http://pbrt.org and http://www.raytracegroundup.com.

Though I take most of the information from these books I develop Tracy from scratch. My goal is to simulate as much effect as possible and create photorealistic images. Through my journey I intend to get to know more and more on the field of computer graphics and experiment with new techiques and algorithms.
